# Surfâ€™s Up Analysis:

## Review of the temperatures and precipitation in Oahu

### Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze the weather patterns in Hawaii to evaluate where the bast location is to open a surf and ice cream shop. The investor had a previous investment in a similar shop and would like to be better prepared this time.  He would like to determine if a surf and ice cream shop would have enough business to be open year-round.  Therefore, he asked for additional information about the temperatures for June and December in Oahu.

For this analysis I used Jupyter Notebook and SQLite as well as libraries and functions from NumPy, Pandas, SQLAlchemy.  These methods allow for easier evaluation and comparison of the results.

### Results:

One of the first items reviewed was the precipitation for one year, from August 23, 2016, thru August 23, 2017.  The statistical information for the participation was also calculated.  The results of the reviews are:

-	As you can see from the results, the precipitation is low for most of the year with an average of almost 18%

A review was also conducted on the temperatures for June and December in conjunction with the precipitation.  The results are below:

The results of the reviews show that:

-	The average temperature is about 75 degrees in June and 71 degrees in December.

-	June had a max temperature of 85 degrees and the max temperature in December was 83 degrees, which is consistent with the average temperatures.

-	The average precipitation in June is 13.6% and 21.7% in December.

### Summary

Overall, the weather in Oahu appears to be relatively steady throughout the year.  There also appears to be a low precipitation rate during the year.  Both conditions are ideal for a surfing and eating ice cream and would lend themselves to this being a promising investment to make.  

The data also contained information on stations in Hawaii.  To analyze the best place to open the surf and ice cream shop I would review the stations to look at the weather in specific locations to find the ideal one.  Although, the weather in June and December was similar, December had a wider range of results.  The high temperatures were close but the lows of 56 in December and 64 in June were different and is probably worth analyzing further.
